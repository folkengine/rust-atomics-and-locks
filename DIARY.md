# Diary

This is my notes on playing with the ideas from this book. My plan
is to add and update examples using things that will help me 
visualize the ideas better. To start with, using my 
[cardpack.rs](https://github.com/ContractBridge/cardpack.rs) library. 
The idea I am starting with is that of a card dealer at a casino.
